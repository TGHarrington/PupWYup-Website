This is a mock up of  a website for my CIS 3700 course. The assignment was to write the HTML, CSS, JS, and SQL. The SQL holds the login information (plain text, not a real website) and shceduling information.
The code and content are my work product. All images were created by me. 
Puppies With Yuppies is my families Facebook page for the puppies we foster.
